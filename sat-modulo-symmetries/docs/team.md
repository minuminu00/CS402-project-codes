SAT modulo Symmetries was introduced by Kirchweger and Szeider ([link](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_300078.pdf)). In the meantime, many people helped to extend SMS, make it easier to use and apply it to some interesting problem.

We also want to thank Katalin Fazekas for implementing an easy-to-use interface to Cadical allowing adding custom propagators. This allowed us to use Cadical as the underlying SAT solver.
